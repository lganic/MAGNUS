# MAGNUS
program for ti-84 to do basic and advanced operations on vectors 

how to use:
vectors are represeneted by their components and should be input like this: (1,2,3)
2 dimensional vectors are also supported and are input as such: (1,2)
scalar values are input surrounded by ^ like so: ^15^

Currently supported operations:
parenthesis support, to chain multiple operations together. Operations will always follow proper parenthesis rules. 
vector cross product: (1,2,3)*(4,5,6)
vector dot product (1,2,3)(4,5,6)
vector addition (1,2,3)+(4,5,6)
vector subtraction (1,2,3)-(4,5,6)
vector multiplication by scalar: (1,2,3)^5^ or ^5^(1,2,3)
angle between two vectors: (1,2,3)A(4,5,6)
absolute value of vector abs(-1,-2,-3)
vector projection (1,2,3)P(4,5,6) note that this projects (1,2,3) onto (4,5,6)
magnitude of vector M(1,2,3)
scalar multiplication ^5^*^3^
scalar division ^5^/^3^
scalar addition ^5^+^3^
scalar subtraction ^5^-^3^
square scalar ^5^²

there are most likely things which should be implemented into this program that are missing currently, if you have one that you feel needs to be implemented please reach out to me and ill do my best to put it into the program.
